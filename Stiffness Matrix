%Stiffiness matrix generation
NDOF% the degree of freedom will be define here
IND=[3 4 1 2];% index assigned for the degree of freedom at joints of the truss
for i=1:NDOF(4);% this i will have the  four values of assigned member end degree
                % of freedom
if IND(i)<=NDOF;% collection in rows
    for j=1:4; % collection in Columns
        if ind(j)<=NDOF; % check for the degree freedom
            S(ind(i),ind(j))=S(ind(i),ind(j)+K(i,j));
        end;
    end;
end;
end;   % I am still fixing the version to make work properly
